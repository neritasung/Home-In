# Home-In

We believe making a housing decision shouldn't consume all of your time and mental energy. This mobile friendly app is designed to help users searching for a home within 5 specific neighborhoods of Minneapolis.

Users will be able to add listing to their Favorites page and look at the next house by simplying cliking on the right arrow, or skip to the next lising by clicking on left arrow.

The app uses 2 API's, Zillow and Walk Score. Zillow provides information for users on the house, such as, pictures of the houses, asking price, Zestimate, number of bedrooms, number of baths, year built, and mortage estimate.

Walk Score provides users scores from scale of 0 to 100 (100 being the best), score on bike friendliness, transit score, and walkability score (walkable distance).
